# ChipSoft - C# Coding Challenge

### Welcome to the ChipSoft coding challenge!

The purpose of this challenge is to put your skills on display!
All the necessary data to complete this test (and the following ones) can be found in this solution.
Some parts you will have to make yourself, some might be already (partially) available.
Go through the structure and files and see if you can make sense of it.

You can use the internet to look things up, but please refrain from using AI to solve these problems.
Feel free to ask questions about the challenge, we will answer as we see fit :)

The goal: to make sure all the provided tests are green, whilst showing off your hard earned programming prowess.
However, this is not just a race, the quality of your code will play an important part in the scoring aswell! 

Important note: THE TESTS THEMSELVES ARE NOT TO BE TOUCHED. Neither are the embedded resources. 
All other code is merely suggestive and is free to be changed as you see fit.

Show us your programming skills by completing the code to make all the tests work!
